# Tic-Tac-Toe-
A simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built in C++ that allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid. The program checks for winning conditions after each move and declares a winner or a draw. This project helps practice basic programming concepts like arrays, loops, input validation, and game logic implementation.
